# Little World
Created by Mitchell Santomartino
 
### Overview
A simple ecosystem simulation that is populated by AI NPCs and a controllable player character. Little World was made by Mitchell Santomartino as an attempt to explore/learn about creating AI systems/mechanics. The goal for the player is simply to satisfy their hunger and fight off enemies. NPCs spawn in with randomized stats that include: health points, attack damage, speed, and more. There is also a fight or flight mechanic where depending on an NPCs retreat chance stat, once hit by an enemy they will either stay and fight the enemy or retreat. There are two basic variants of NPCs: Herbivore and Carnivore. Herbivores roam around and eat berries that spawn on bushes to satisfy their hunger, and have a high chance of fleeing from combat. Carnivores roam in search of other NPCsto attack and eat to satisfy their hunger, and have a low chance of fleeing combat.
